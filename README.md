👋 Hi, I’m Abhinavpreet Singh

👀 I am interested in coding, currently focusing on web and app development, and working on my website. In the future, I aim to build a robust and high-performance operating system.

🌱 I’m currently focusing on my Computer Science Engineering course, learning various languages such as Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, C++, and many more.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on exciting coding projects, especially those that challenge my web development or software development skills. I'm open to learning and working with others to create something impactful.

📫 You can reach me via my discord - apsarora_16935

😄 Pronouns: he/him

⚡ Fun fact: I can play multiple percussion instruments and often code while jamming out to some of my favourite tunes!
